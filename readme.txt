**What is MailChimp?**

if( function_exists( 'mc4wp_form' ) ) {

= Where can I find my MailChimp API key? =
[You can find your MailChimp API key here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys#Find-or-Generate-Your-API-Key)

= How to add a sign-up checkbox to my Contact Form 7 form? =
Use the following shortcode in your CF7 form to display a MailChimp sign-up checkbox.

`
[mc4wp_checkbox "Subscribe to our newsletter?"]
`

More information:

- [Add a MailChimp subscribe checkbox to Contact Form 7](https://mc4wp.com/kb/add-sign-checkbox-contact-form-7/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

= I am getting spam sign-ups =

To prevent bots from subscribing, you can take the following anti-spam measures.

- Enable double opt-in in the plugin settings.
- Install the [Goodbye Captcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/goodbye-captcha/) plugin.

More information:

- [Prevent bots from subscribing to your MailChimp list](https://mc4wp.com/kb/preventing-bots-subscribing/)

= The form shows a success message but subscribers are not added to my list(s)? =
If the form shows a success message, there is no doubt that the sign-up request succeeded. MailChimp could have a slight delay sending the confirmation email though, please just be patient and make sure to check your SPAM folder.

When you have double opt-in disabled, new subscribers will be seen as *imports* by MailChimp. They will not show up in your daily digest emails or statistics. [We always recommend leaving double opt-in enabled](http://blog.mailchimp.com/double-opt-in-vs-single-opt-in-stats/).

= How can I style the sign-up form? =
You can use custom CSS to style the sign-up form if you do not like the themes that come with the plugin. The following selectors can be used to target the various form elements.

`
.mc4wp-form { ... } /* the form element */
.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
.mc4wp-form input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.mc4wp-form input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
.mc4wp-alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
.mc4wp-success { ... } /* success message */
.mc4wp-error { ... } /* error messages */
`

You can add your custom CSS to your theme stylesheet or (easier) by using a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

[>> With the Pro plugin it's really easy to design beautiful forms <<](https://mc4wp.com/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

= Can I add a checkbox to third-party forms? =
Yes, you can include the following HTML in any form.

`
<label>
	<input type="checkbox" name="mc4wp-subscribe" value="1" />
	Subscribe to our newsletter?
</label>
`

MailChimp for WordPress will automatically find the `name` and `email` field and subscribe to the list selected in **MailChimp for WP > Checkboxes**.

More information:

- [Add MailChimp subscribe checkbox to custom form](https://mc4wp.com/kb/add-sign-checkbox-custom-form/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

= How do I add subscribers to certain interest groups? =

You can use the field wizard (located on the right side then editing a form) to generate the correct HTML for you, if you have the groups created in your MailChimp account.

If you are more advanced then you are free to edit the HTML in any way you like, as long as the basic structure of the `name` and `value` attributes stays the same.

_Example (group choice):_
`
<label><input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 1" /> Group 1</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 2" /> Group 2</label>
`

_Example (hidden field):_

`
<input type="hidden" name="GROUPINGS[###]" value="Groupname 1,Groupname 2,Groupname 3" />
`

= I'm getting an "HTTP Error" when trying to connect to MailChimp =
If you're getting an `HTTP Error` when trying to connect to your MailChimp account, please contact your webhost and ask them if they have PHP CURL installed and updated to the latest version (7.40.x).
